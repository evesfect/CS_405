Project 2 Information:
Texture 2 is for normal maps in OpenGL format. DirectX normal maps should be inverted in order for them to work.
Two example normal maps can be found in the resources folder. 
In order to see the normal maps best, try using bark_willow_diff as texture 1 and bark_willow_nor_gl as texture 2.
